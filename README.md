# MiniProject-deviceHarmony
This project aims to connect devices such as pc, laptops, mobile, tab in a web-app and lets access to all the files in every device using a centralized dashboard.

The dashboard allows the users to connect devices available on LAN and let them access files from every device through a central device.
So that the user can access all the files without touching the secondary devices. 
This was initiated to improve workflow and not depend on cloud/mail/chat transfer of file every time.
